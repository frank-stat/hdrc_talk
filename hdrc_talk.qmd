## NRS - How are population estimates calculated?

-   [Population estimates are based on the census and are updated each year to account for population change from 1 July to 30 June. They are based on the usually resident population which covers people living in Scotland for a period of at least 12 months, whatever their nationality.](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/publications/mid-2024-population-estimates/)

## 

::: equation
$${\frac{\text{Events}}{\text{Population}}}$$
:::

-   Move from unlinked to linked so sure same population above and below the division line

::: equation
$$\boxed{\frac{\text{Events}}{\text{Population}}}$$
:::

-   CHI to the rescue ...

## PHS - Data dictionary

-   [The Community Health Index (CHI) is a population register, which is used in Scotland for health care purposes. The CHI number uniquely identifies a person on the index.](https://publichealthscotland.scot/resources-and-tools/health-intelligence-and-data-management/national-data-catalogue/data-dictionary/search-the-data-dictionary/chi-number/)

## Our use of CHI

-   After DPIA etc. receive monthly abstract for people with NHS Grampian address
-   Extract living population
-   Update monthly: births, deaths, entries and exit
-   Effectively a cohort starting March 2024
-   Pseudo anonymised
-   Link to health records that usually have CHI

## CHI versus NRS

## Unique Property Reference Number - UK Government

-   [UPRNs are the unique identifiers for every addressable location in Great Britain](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/identifying-property-and-street-information)
-   CHI register includes UPRNs but
-   Addresses messy, we worked to increase coverage
-   Housing and health project around 90% have UPRN
-   From UPRN can derive households
-   Households updated daily

## Population platform

-   A documented updated resource rather than just data

-   Can be pseudo anonymised linked to modules:

    -   Community prescriptions

    -   NHS admissions and ICD codes

    -   Out of hours GP

    -   Operations

    -   Waitings lists

-   External data
